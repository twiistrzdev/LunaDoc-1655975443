## Edit the configuration
At the root of the project, you will find a file named `sample-config.js`,
you will have to rename it to `config.js`, and then fill it according to the indicated model.

```json
module.exports = {

// â€”â€” Basic configuration information, essential.

    // â€” The bot's token found in the Discord developer portal â€” in the 'bot' section, under the name.
    Token: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

    /* â€” Your User ID ( Go to the settings of your discord, in the 'Advanced'
         section, then enable 'Developer mode' ) Right click on your profile and 'Copy ID'. */
	Master: "000000000000000000",

    // â€” The secret client for interaction with the Discord API, also found on Discord developers portal, in the 'OAuth2' section, in 'Client information'.
    Secret: "C387_Bp7LZKwQoAMmyUb3t4DjSnpg9DK",

    // â€” URL of your MongoDB database ( see the appropriate section for more details )
    mongodb: "mongodb://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...",

// â€”â€” Activity configuration

    Presence: {
		status: "Online",
        // â€”â€” You can add unlimited number of games, or none in fact, just leave it like this: games: []
		games: [{
            // â€” 'type' can be PLAYING STREAMING LISTENING WATCHING COMPETING, you need to provide Twitch URL for STREAMING
		    type: "WATCHING",
		    name: "You",
		    url: ""
		}, {
            type: "PLAYING",
		    name: "A cool game",
		    url: ""
        }],

        //Â â€”Â Status will change every 15 seconds
		interval: 15
	},

}
```

## Installation of MongoDB
MongoDB, like all other databases, is available in several variants depending
on the development needs. The variants have been listed below and can be
used or downloaded from this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/try)

You can choose between the cloud and "local".

    For a local installation, more complex, I advise you to follow the steps described in the [guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) of the official site

#### For Cloud ( Atlas ) Solution :

1. Once you have created an account navigate to the cluster page and create a free cluster.
2. Next wait for the changes to be deployed ( this could take upto 5 minutes ), click the connect button.
3. Select the Allow Access from Anywhere button and then Add Ip Address.
4. Create a `dbUser` and `dbUserPassword` and hold onto this for later.
5. Navigate to `Choose a connection method`, click `Connect your application` and copy the provided link.
6. Navigate to config.js in your bot and replace the `mongodb://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` the bottom with the link you have copied. Make sure to replace `<password>` with the password you created.
