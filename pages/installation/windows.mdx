    ![powershellAdmin](/installation/window/powershellAdmin.png)

    Run the following command :

    ` npm install --global windows-build-tools `

    After installation, npm will automatically execute this module, which downloads and installs Visual C++ Build Tools, provided free of charge for most users by Microsoft (as part of Visual Studio Community, please consult the license to determine whether or not you're eligible). These tools are required to compile popular native modules.

## Installation


Open a terminal, and navigate to the location where you want to install Luna, then type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asgarrrr/Luna
```

Once the clone is done, you have the project as it is on [Github](https://github.com/Asgarrrr/Luna),
then type these two commands, the first one will make you enter the folder, and the second one will install
the dependencies needed to run Luna

```bash
cd Luna
```

```bash
npm install --production
```
